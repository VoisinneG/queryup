## R CMD check results

To check the queryup package on multiple OS, I have set up github actions 
using `usethis::use_github_action("check-standard")`

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs

## check_win_devel() results
Using `devtools::check_win_devel()` produced one note stating that
the package has been removed from CRAN.
However the deadline for correcting the errors is today (04/04/2023).
